# MacDevKit CLI

A Rust CLI wrapper for the MacDevKit setup script. This tool provides a modern command-line interface for setting up your macOS development environment.

## Overview

MacDevKit CLI is a Rust-based command-line tool that wraps the functionality of the MacDevKit bash script (`init.sh`). It provides a more user-friendly and interactive experience while leveraging the proven functionality of the original script.

## Features

- Modern CLI interface with subcommands
- Interactive menu for easy navigation
- Colorful output for better readability
- Progress indicators and confirmations
- Works seamlessly with the original MacDevKit bash script

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- macOS (This tool is specifically designed for macOS)

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/macdevkit-cli.git
   cd macdevkit-cli
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Install the binary (optional):
   ```
   cargo install --path .
   ```

## Usage

```
macdevkit-cli
```

This will display a menu where you can select the operation you want to perform.

### Using Subcommands

You can also use specific subcommands to run individual setup steps:

```
